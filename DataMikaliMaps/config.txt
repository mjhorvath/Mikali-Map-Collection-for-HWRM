// This is a comment line.  Any line that begins with 2 forward slashes is ignored.
// Config items consist of a keyword followed by a colon followed by data specifically
// for that keyword.  For example: "Title: My First Homeworld MOD".  Data for a keyword
// must appear on the same line as the keyword.  The only exception to this rule is the
// "Description:" keyword which must appear on a line by itself followed by lines of text
// that will be used as the description of the item in the Steam Workshop.  All text that
// appears after the "Description:" keyword will become part of the item description on
// Steam Workshop.  The description text is limited to 8,000 characters total in length.

If you have the Steam version of the game, installation is done by subscribing to the mod on the Steam Workshop page, and then using the "Mods" section of the game launcher to select which mods you want to activate.

For the GOG.com version of the game--or if you want to view and modify the mods's source code--you must download the mod from GitHub, then copy the "DataMikaliMaps" folder to your "Homeworld Remastered" or "HomeworldRM" directory. Next, you must add the text "-moddatapath DataMikaliMaps -overrideBigFile -luatrace" to the "Target" field of the game's desktop shortcut in order to get the mod working.
____
If you are not using the game launcher and are trying to load more than one mod at the same time, simply append or prepend the name of each mod's data folder after the "-moddatapath" command line parameter. For instance: "-moddatapath DataPlayersPatch,DataMikaliMaps,DataTestMod". Multiple names should be separated by a comma.
____
Note that the PlayersPatch is listed before my mod, and the Test mod is listed after it. The order in which mods are listed matters, and mods that are listed to the right in the list override the data belonging to mods that are listed to the left. Exactly which mod should appear first, and which mods should appear afterward, varies from mod to mod.
