// This is a comment line.  Any line that begins with 2 forward slashes is ignored.
// Config items consist of a keyword followed by a colon followed by data specifically
// for that keyword.  For example: "Title: My First Homeworld MOD".  Data for a keyword
// must appear on the same line as the keyword.  The only exception to this rule is the
// "Description:" keyword which must appear on a line by itself followed by lines of text
// that will be used as the description of the item in the Steam Workshop.  All text that
// appears after the "Description:" keyword will become part of the item description on
// Steam Workshop.  The description text is limited to 8,000 characters total in length.
